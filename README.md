# Slack-Project
Slack-Clone is a clone of a slack. Implemented using React and Firebase. Behind the backend, I was used React-Firebase for authentication with Google-auth, and highly secure specially for non-authorized users. And I have developed a channel section to add new channels and communicate through these channels.
